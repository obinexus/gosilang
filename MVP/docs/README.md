# Gosilang

**The World's First Polyglot Programming Language**

Gosilang is a laboratory for developing a revolutionary programming paradigm: a truly polyglot language system. It moves beyond simple foreign function interfaces (FFIs) to create a unified syntactic and semantic layer that allows for seamless interoperability and code composition across multiple programming languages.

## Vision

To eliminate technological silos and enable developers to focus on problem-solving by leveraging the unique strengths of every language within a single, coherent codebase.

## Core Concepts

*   **Polyglot Runtime:** A runtime environment designed to natively execute and interoperate between languages like Python, C, Rust, and JavaScript.
*   **Unified AST:** A common Abstract Syntax Tree that can represent constructs from various source languages.
*   **Type Bridging:** Intelligent and automatic bridging of types and data structures across language boundaries.
*   **Gossip Protocol:** A distributed communication layer for coordinating execution across potentially disparate runtime environments.

## Status

**Laboratory / Research Phase.** This repository contains experimental code, design documents, and proofs-of-concept. Contributions, ideas, and research collaborations are welcome.

## Getting Started

1.  **Clone the repo:** `git clone https://github.com/your-org/gosilang.git`
2.  **Explore the `/specs` directory** for architectural overviews.
3.  **Check the `/examples` directory** for early demonstrations of polyglot calls.
